         all of your db connections. Set to -1 for no limit.

         Set to -1 for no limit.  See also the DBCP documentation on this
         and the minEvictableIdleTimeMillis configuration parameter.
         maxIdle: (int) The maximum number of connections that should be kept in the pool at all times.
         Default value is maxActive:100 Idle connections are checked periodically (if enabled)
         and connections that been idle for longer than minEvictableIdleTimeMillis will be released. (also see testWhileIdle)

    <!-- maxWait: (int) The maximum number of milliseconds that the pool will wait (when there are no available connections)

         for a connection to be returned before throwing an exception. Default value is 30000 (30 seconds).
         In this example 8 seconds. An Exception is thrown if  this timeout is exceeded.  Set to -1 to wait indefinitely.

                removeAbandoned - (boolean) Flag to remove abandoned connections if they exceed the removeAbandonedTimout.

                If set to true a connection is considered abandoned and eligible for removal if it has been in use longer than the removeAbandonedTimeout.

                Setting this to true can recover db connections from applications that fail to close a connection.
                See also logAbandoned The default value is false.

                removeAbandonedTimeout - (long) Timeout in seconds before an abandoned(in use) connection can be removed.

                The default value is 60 (60 seconds). The value should be set to the longest running query your applications might have.
