		We believe that well-informed and educated people feel free, act in a conscious way, generate valuable ideas and are willing to help.
		For that we are striving "to make the world a better educated place" by gathering in one place valuable information in the form of 
		<a href="<c:url value="/podcasting"/>">podcasts</a>,
		that are easily accessible, searchable and can be downloaded and listened to on the go.
	</p>
	<p>
		(P.S.)
		For such a mighty task a little <a href="<c:url value="/how_can_i_help"/>">support</a> can make a BIG difference
