	<p>
		A podcast is a type of digital media consisting of an episodic series of files (either audio or video)
		subscribed to and downloaded through web syndication or streamed online to a computer or mobile device. 
		The word is a neologism derived from "broadcast" and "pod" from the success of the iPod, 
		as podcasts are often listened to on portable media players.
